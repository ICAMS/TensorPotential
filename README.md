# TensorPotential

`Tensorpotential` is a TensorFlow based tool for development, fitting ML interatomic potentials from electronic structure
calculations data and perform computations using these potentials. Documentation is coming soon<sup>TM</sup> ...

## Potentials
Only Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) is available at the moment, and it is intended to be used via `pacemaker` interface.
Please see [`python-ace`](https://github.com/ICAMS/python-ace) page for details.
